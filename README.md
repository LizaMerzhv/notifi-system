# Notification Delivery System

A scalable and fault-tolerant platform for sending mass notifications through various channels (email, SMS, messengers, push). Users can manage contacts, create templates, and send messages with guaranteed delivery ‚Äî even in case of service or provider failures.

## Features

- Import and manage user contacts (CSV/XLS upload, manual entry)
- Contact groups and template management
- Multi-channel notification delivery (email, SMS, push, messengers)
- Kafka-based messaging and worker queue
- Delivery status tracking and auto-retry with rebalancer service
- Horizontally scalable architecture (up to 1M recipients)
- Role-based authentication and authorization
- Monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

## Tech Stack

- **Java 17**, Spring Boot (Web, Security, Validation)
- **Apache Kafka** ‚Äì messaging broker
- **PostgreSQL**, **Redis** ‚Äì storage and caching
- **Docker**, **Docker Compose**
- **JUnit**, **Mockito**, **Testcontainers** ‚Äì testing
- **Maven / Gradle**
- **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **ELK** ‚Äì observability
- Third-party integrations: **Amazon SES**, **Twilio**, **ApplePush**

## System Architecture

### Components

- **API Service**  
  Handles CRUD operations for contacts, groups, templates. Publishes notifications to Kafka.

- **Kafka**  
  Acts as a message queue. Workers consume notification tasks from relevant topics.

- **Worker**  
  Consumes messages from Kafka, sends messages via email/SMS/etc., updates delivery status in DB.

- **Rebalancer**  
  Periodically scans DB for failed messages and republishes them to Kafka for retry.

- **PostgreSQL**  
  Stores users, contacts, templates, delivery logs.

- **Redis**  
  Caches frequently used **notification templates** to speed up rendering and reduce DB load.

- **Third-party providers**  
  Email (Amazon SES), SMS (Twilio), Push (ApplePush), etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è TODO

The project is still under development. Below is the list of pending implementation steps:


1. **Mass notification delivery**  
   - Retrieve contacts by group ID  
   - Determine correct delivery channel  
   - Send messages (initially via mock services)  
   - Store delivery statuses  
   - Integrate with Amazon SES (email), Twilio (SMS)  

2. **Rebalancer implementation**  
   - Scan DB for undelivered messages  
   - Re-publish to retry topic in Kafka  
   - Update Worker to process retries and track attempts  

3. **Status tracking and delivery logs API**  
   - Implement endpoints to view notification history  
   - Add filters (by contact, status, date, etc.)
